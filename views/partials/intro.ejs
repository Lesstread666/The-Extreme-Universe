        <h2>Welcome to the Extreme Universe</h2>
        <p>The universe is a place of extremes. From objects with gravity so strong that not even light can escape, to
            cosmic events that release more energy in seconds than our Sun will emit in its entire lifetime.
            <br><br>
            This website is an educational guide to some of the most extreme phenomena in the universe. It explores how
            these objects and events form, how they behave, and why they are important to our understanding of space.
            <br><br>
            Use the navigation to explore extreme cosmic objects or powerful astronomical events, and learn how they
            shape the universe around us.
