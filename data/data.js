  intro:
    `Extreme cosmic objects are among the most unusual and powerful structures in the universe.
They form under conditions of immense gravity, pressure, and energy, pushing the laws of
physics to their limits.

Objects such as neutron stars and supermassive black holes are created during the final
stages of massive stars and play a major role in shaping galaxies and testing fundamental
physical theories.`,

        "A neutron star is the dense remnant left after a massive star explodes in a supernova, composed almost entirely of neutrons.",
      formation:
        "When a massive star runs out of fuel, its core collapses under gravity and protons and electrons merge into neutrons.",

      observation:
        "Neutron stars are detected through radio waves, X-rays, and gamma rays, often observed as pulsars.",

    `Cosmic events are powerful, often short-lived phenomena that dramatically affect their
surrounding space. Unlike permanent objects, these events represent moments of extreme
energy release or transformation in the universe.

Events such as supernovae and gamma-ray bursts spread heavy elements, influence star
formation, and provide insight into the most energetic processes in the cosmos.`,
